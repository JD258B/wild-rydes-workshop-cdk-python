# wild-rydes-workshop-cdk-python
Walked through the Wild Rydes Workshop and created it in the AWS CDK in python

The [workshop](https://webapp.serverlessworkshops.io/) that I followed.

I have removed parts of the source for the website as it contained aws account number and information.
It is important to initialize it with the amplify cli anyway.

I walked through the workshop and created each item in a CDK app. This is mainly an attempt to learn the CDK in python.

I had to fix a few issues in the source vue code. So if you pull it from the official workshop github repo please be aware there are issues in a few of the Vue files.
